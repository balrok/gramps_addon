        This method is used to recursively convert the object into a
        self-documenting form that can easily be used for various
        purposes, including diffs and queries.

        These structures may be primitive Python types (string,
        integer, boolean, etc.) or complex Python types (lists,
        tuples, or dicts). If the return type is a dict, then the keys
        of the dict match the fieldname of the object. If the return
        struct (or value of a dict key) is a list, then it is a list
        of structs. Otherwise, the struct is just the value of the
        attribute.
