This package implements unittest support for GRAMPS

It includes a test-running program regrtest.py,
 and various test support utility modules
  (first one created being test_util.py)

Also includes tests for code in the parent (src) directory
and other tests that may be considered top-level tests
  
Note: tests for utility code in this directory would be in a
subdirectory also named test by convention for gramps testing.

Note: test subdirectories do not normally need to have a 
package-enabling module __init__.py, but this one (src/test) does 
because it contains utilities used by other test modules.
Thus, this package would allow test code like
  from test import test_util
